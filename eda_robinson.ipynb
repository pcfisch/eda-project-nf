    "|Client assignment| Find properties in poor neighborhoods that I can invest in (buy, sell) in a socially responsible way. I want my costs back plus a little profit.\n",

    "### Data set and thought process\n",
    "King County Housing data set with $N = 21597$ properties where $n = 21420$ are individual properties ($n = 176$ properties were sold more than once).\n",
    "The data set has already been cleaned for the specific chosen clients assignment at hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since there was no further definition given for *poor neighborhoods*, I defined them as follows:\n",
    "*poor neighborhoods* = Zipcode areas where at least 80% of the properties' prices fall into the second quartile.\n",
    "I.e. the maximum buying price would be the median price over all properties. For all analysis and graphic depictions I used this sub dataset of poor neighborhoods according to this definition. Data cleaning process as well as some premature data exploration can be found in the [cleaning_data.ipynb](cleaning_data.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hypothesis\n",
    "The following hypotheses were chosen in order to decide on what properties to focus on within the poor neighborhood areas once those were found.\n",
    "1. The lower the current condition, the lower the price\n",
    "2. The farther away from the city center, the lower the price\n",
    "3. The longer ago the last renovation, the lower the price"

A further consideration of time since last renovation is only in so far efficient if we focus on properties where we have that information or which are not older than 40 years. Otherwise this information would have to be retrieved from KCH. It should be considered that the longer ago the last renovation, the more probably unforeseen problems (and costs) will arise, independent from KCH condition rating.\n",

    "* last renovation not longer ago than 40 years\n",
