# EDA Training Project, dp-Neuefische

This repository is all about a training project on exploratory data analysis (EDA) I did in the scope of my data practitioner training with [Neuefische](https://www.neuefische.de/bootcamp/data-part-time).<br>

- This project is centered around exploratory data
analysis techniques and presentation of results to a client.
- Through EDA/statistical analysis above please come up with **AT LEAST 3 insights** regarding the overall data. One should be geographical.
- In addition also come up with **AT LEAST 3 recommendations** for your client.
- Choose a client from the list of made up clients. Chosen client:
>Erin Robinson. Buyer, Invest in poor neighborhood, buying & selling, costs back + little profit, socially responsible

## Requirements
The [requirements file](requirements.txt)  holds a list of all the packages and dependencies needed. Other than that you will need

## Data set
The King County Housing Data: This dataset contains information about home sales in King County (USA).
In the [column_names file]('column_names.md') you can find a description of the variables of the data set.

## Cleaning and EDA
Getting familiar with the data and the cleaning process (preprocessing) are described in the [cleaning_data notebook](cleaning_data.ipynb). The exploratory data analysis process is written down in the [EDA_Robinson notebook](EDA_Robinson.ipynb).

## Presentation
You can find the slides used for presenting the results to a fictive non-technical audience in the [KCH_cl-Robinson file](KCH_cl-Robinson.pdf).
